# Axes Are Weapons

A Fabric Minecraft mod which disables the increased durability loss in combat and enables Looting for axes.

Axes normally lose 2 durability when hitting things because they are considered a mining tool, not a weapon.  
This mod fixes that, making them lose only 1 durability point, just like swords.  
It also enables Looting for axes, while Knockback and Fire Aspect can be enabled in the config.

- requires Minecraft 1.16.2+, Fabric Loader 0.11.1+ and [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config)
- works server-only
- works in single player when installed on the client
