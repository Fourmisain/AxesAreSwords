# Axes Are Weapons

A Fabric Minecraft mod which disables the increased durability loss in combat and enables Looting for axes.

Axes normally lose 2 durability when hitting things because they are considered a mining tool, not a weapon.
This mod fixes that, making them lose only 1 durability point, just like swords.
It also enables Looting for axes but no more so to not take away from swords - Knockback and Fire Aspect are still exclusive to them.

- requires Minecraft 1.16.2+, Fabric Loader 0.11.1+
- works server-only
- works in single player when installed on the client
