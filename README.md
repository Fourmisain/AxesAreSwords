# Axes Are Weapons

A Fabric Minecraft mod which disables the increased durability loss in combat and enables Looting for axes.

Axes normally lose 2 durability when hitting things because they are considered a mining tool, not a weapon.  
This mod fixes that, making them lose only 1 durability point, just like swords.  
It also enables Looting for axes, while Knockback, Fire Aspect and modded sword enchantments can be enabled in the config.  
By default, damage enchantments (Sharpness, Smite and Bane of the Bane of Arthropods) will now also appear in the Enchanting Table, so you won't have to rely on books.
